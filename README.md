## SUMMARY:
 We programmed 2 races between 2 turtles. In the first one we assigned each turtle a random distance to travel. In the second one we had each turtle take 10 steps and each step was a random distance. After the race we had one turtle draw 5 shapes in a double for loop that drew one shape, cleared it, and drew the next one.
